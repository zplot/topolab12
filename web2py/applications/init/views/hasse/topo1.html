        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Finite T0-spaces are in correspondence with finite partially ordered sets(posets).</p>

<p>A useful way to represent finite T0-spaces is with their Hasse diagrams. The Hasse diagram of a poset X is a digraph
   whose vertices are the points of X and whose edges are the ordered pairs (x, y) such that x < y and there exists no z âˆˆ X such that x < z < y. In the graphical representation of a Hasse diagram we will not write an arrow from x to y, but a segment with y over x

You can use this application to draw Hasse diagrams of finte T0-spaces.</p>

<p>You can use brackets or braces to define the points and open sets of a topological basis as shown in the following
     example: </p>

<h4>Example:</h4>
<br>
<h5>points = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</h5>
<h5>basis = [[6,2,1],[5,2,1,3],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1]]</h5>
